# Mahjong

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/cheshire137/Mahjong.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cheshire137/Mahjong)

An implementation of [Mahjong solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_solitaire) as a Rails app. You can [try it out](https://mahjong-rails.herokuapp.com/) on my Heroku app.

## How to Develop

You'll need Ruby 2+ and PostgreSQL.

### First Time Setup

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:seed

### Every Time

    bundle exec rails s

## How to Test

    bundle install
    bundle exec rake test

## How Tiles are Positioned

X coordinates are in black horizontally across the top, y coordinates are in pale blue vertically along the left, and z coordinates are in yellow. See the coordinates in [layouts/turtle.txt](layouts/turtle.txt).
